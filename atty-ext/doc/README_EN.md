# Atty-ext

This is an extension of the framework, and it expands on something that the framework doesn't.
Like what:
- SimpleMessageCodec that integrates Encoder and Decoder
- An improved version of IEncoder, also known as SimpleMessageEncoder
- Improved IHandler - SimpleMessageHandler
- Built-in String communication decoder (not much use.)
